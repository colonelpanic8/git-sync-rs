# git-sync-rs Restart Context

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created comprehensive PLAN.md document
- ✅ Set up project structure with Cargo.toml dependencies
- ✅ Created error types in `src/error.rs` with exit codes matching original
- ✅ Implemented `RepositorySynchronizer` in `src/sync.rs` with:
  - Repository state detection (clean, dirty, rebasing, etc.)
  - Sync state analysis (ahead, behind, diverged, equal)
  - Auto-commit functionality
  - Core sync operations (fetch, push, fast-forward, rebase)
- ✅ Created basic `src/main.rs` for testing
- ✅ Set up nix flake with OpenSSL dependencies
- ✅ Created `.envrc` for direnv support

### Next Steps

1. **Test the build** - Run `cargo build` to verify everything compiles
2. **Test basic functionality** - Try running the sync on a test repository
3. **Iterate on core sync logic** based on testing results
4. **Add unit tests** for the synchronization logic

### Key Implementation Notes

- Using `git2` library for Git operations
- Exit codes match original: 0 (success), 1 (manual intervention), 2 (unsafe state), 3 (network), 128 (not a repo)
- Current config is hardcoded in main.rs - needs to be made configurable later
- Sync flow: check state → auto-commit → fetch → analyze → merge/rebase/push → verify

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run check mode on current repo
cargo run -- check

# Run sync mode (when ready)
cargo run -- sync
```

### Known Issues to Address

- Branch name is hardcoded as "main" - needs to detect current branch
- Config is hardcoded - needs to read from git config/TOML/CLI args
- SSH authentication uses ssh-agent - may need more auth options
- No dry-run mode yet
- No verbose/quiet output control yet

### Architecture Decisions Made

- Single `RepositorySynchronizer` struct owns the repository and config
- Separate enums for `RepositoryState` and `SyncState`
- Using `thiserror` for error types with automatic exit code mapping
- Sync operations are synchronous (async only needed for watch mode later)
